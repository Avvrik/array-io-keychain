# KeyChain

## Overview

**KeyChain** is a standalone app for signing transactions and generating key pairs. It stores private keys in an isolated environment where no logger, debugger or spyware can intercept them because of the three-layer security protecting each action of the system.
**KeyChain** supports transactions from and to various blockchains, including Ethereum and Ethereum classic, Litecoin, Bitcoin, and Bitshares. 

You can integrate **KeyChain** as a service through `pipe` or `websocket` methods. For quick step-by-step guides see [Pipe integration guide](https://github.com/arrayio/array-io-keychain/wiki/Pipe-API) and [WebSocket integration guide](https://github.com/arrayio/array-io-keychain/wiki/WebSocket-API) that you can find in the corresponding API. For simple installation tutorials for Windows, MacOs, and Linux go to [Installation guides](https://github.com/arrayio/array-io-keychain/wiki/Installation-guides). 

Read full [KeyChain Protocol](https://github.com/arrayio/array-io-keychain/wiki/KeyChain-Protocol) with comprehensive descriptions of JSON requests broken down into simple commands and parameters. 

### Demo pages
