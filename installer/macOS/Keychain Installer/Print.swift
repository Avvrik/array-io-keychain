/// Writes the textual representations of the given items most suitable for
/// debugging into the standard output.
///
/// You can pass zero or more items to the
/// `debugPrint(_:separator:terminator:)` function. The textual representation
/// for each item is the same as that obtained by calling
/// `String(reflecting: item)`. The following example prints the debugging
/// representation of a string, a closed range of integers, and a group of
/// floating-point values to standard output:
///
///     debugPrint("One two three four five")
///     // Prints "One two three four five"
///
///     debugPrint(1...5)
///     // Prints "ClosedRange(1...5)"
///
///     debugPrint(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0)
///     // Prints "1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0"
///
/// To print the items separated by something other than a space, pass a string
/// as `separator`.
///
///     debugPrint(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, separator: " ... ")
///     // Prints "1.0 ... 2.0 ... 3.0 ... 4.0 ... 5.0"
///
/// The output from each call to `debugPrint(_:separator:terminator:)` includes
/// a newline by default. To print the items without a trailing newline, pass
/// an empty string as `terminator`.
///
///     for n in 1...5 {
///         debugPrint(n, terminator: "")
///     }
///     // Prints "12345"
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - items: Zero or more items to print.
///   - separator: A string to print between each item. The default is a single
///     space (`" "`).
///   - terminator: The string to print after all items have been printed. The
///     default is a newline (`"\n"`).
